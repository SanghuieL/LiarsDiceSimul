To run the simulation simply run: "python3 main.py" in the root project directory.

It is currently configured to run 10 games at a time and will overwrite the existing game data csv files if you don't move or delete them before running again.

If you want to change the number of simulations it runs change the count variable in main.py.

Most of the code is in allClasses.py.
